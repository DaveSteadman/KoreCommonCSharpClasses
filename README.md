# C Sharp Common Classes

A dotnet console program for the development of common classes, before they are cut/paste into more complex applications and relied upon.

Areas:
- 2D and 3D maths, including custome mesh and colour handling.
- World positions with lat/long (spherical Earth) position, calculation, geometry and routes.
- Database wrapper.
- Image (SkiaSharp) wrapper for image processing.
- Generic 1D/2D list and utilities
- Custom time and logging utilities

The classes contain a unit test framework to explore the functionality. Its not meant to be exhaustive, but focus on areas where testing delivers value, or is useful to investigate/demonstrate issues further.
